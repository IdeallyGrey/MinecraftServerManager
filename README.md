# MinecraftServerManager
 
An easy to use TUI for installing, managing, and running Minecraft servers. Works on any Unix-like operating system (Linux, MacOS, etc..) Perfect for a RaspberryPi!

# Installing

1. Grab the installation script from the releases page, or run `wget (link...)` if you are installing in a non-gui enviroment.
2. Move the script to the directory in which you'd like the manager and all the installed servers to be located. This directory does not need to be empty, the script will create a new subdirectory in which everything will be stored.
3. Run the setup script with `sh setup.sh`.

# Usage

You can launch the manager by moving to the MinecraftServerManager directory, and running `sh manager.sh`. From here the process should be self-explanatory.
